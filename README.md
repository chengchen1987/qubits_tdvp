# qubits_tdvp
Investigate thermalization & many-body localization issues of a quantum processor (or spin-1/2 lattices) by time dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm. 

Requires a working version of the ITensor library (https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor) and the TDVP implementation (https://github.com/ITensor/TDVP).
